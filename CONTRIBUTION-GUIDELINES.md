  * site is in maintanance pages

### Getting Started
  * Fork and Star the repository on GitHub [JinnaBalu/bootstrap-pages](https://github.com/JinnaBalu/bootstrap-pages.git)


### Claiming an Issue
  * [View Issues](https://github.com/JinnaBalu/bootstrap-pages/issues) that are currently seeking help from the community.
  * Create a page, or discover a bug, or a new feature that you wish to work on.
  * Please refrain from working on issues that have the label "in progress" applied to them.
  * Using the 'help wanted' label filter is a good way to find available issues.
  * Mention me in a comment of the respective issue: "@JinnaBalu I would like to work on this".
  * The "in progress" label will be applied to the issue, and you will be given 48 hours to complete the task. If you need more time, please @JinnaBalu me and I will happily oblige.

### Resolving an Issue
  *  Create a page, discover a bug or feature you wish to resolve - the file will live in `/Resources`.
  * Fix, create a new page or feature.

### Take over tasks
This is THE most important step. For each issue you resolve, you must create one for someone else to work on!
  * Come up with a feature that you would like to see implemented into the project.
  * Create a new folder in '/Resource' name as you like it 'Azure Login' for example
  * Write a few lines in README.md about your theme.

### Creating a Pull Request
Now that we have claimed an issue, resolved that issue, and/or created a page or feature, we can open up a pull request!
  * Pull in the latest master branch from the project. It may have updated since you started work on your issue.
  * Resolve any merge conflicts that may have occurred during the development process.
  * Push all of the work you have done to your fork on GitHub.
  * Open a [Pull Request](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork/) in the master branch.
  * Use the `Pull Request Template` as the description of your pull request.
